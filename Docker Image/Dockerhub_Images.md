We already have multiple Images on DokcerHub. If you want to use these images then we use pull or run. But for this require the docker account.

#docker login (use your credential)

After Login you will see multiple images. If you want specific version then mention version. To check images.

#docker search imagename

To pull specific versions

#docker pull ubuntu:latest (image:version)
